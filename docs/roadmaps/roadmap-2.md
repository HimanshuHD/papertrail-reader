# Product Roadmap 2

## Reading continuity delivery sequence

Preview refinements in PR #116: #114 smooth direct landing, plus #117 zoom/fit-mode persistence. #118 adds permission-aware single-workspace/library restoration in a separate increment; broader multi-document workspace remains Roadmap 3.

1. [#114](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/issues/114), under #13: PDF content identity and saved-page restoration, with independent storage/identity services and lifecycle composable.
2. [#115](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/issues/115), under #13: PDF bookmarks using the validated persistence foundation.
3. #14: recent documents and library search. EPUB location persistence follows #12 independently.

#13 stays open until its remaining format and bookmark acceptance is recorded.

Owner: [#78](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/issues/78). Delivery status: [progress tracker](../trackers/progress.md); [status audit](../trackers/status-audit.md); [branch maintenance](../trackers/branch-maintenance.md). v1.0.0 is released; this roadmap builds on the browser PDF reader.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [Preparation](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/1)                        | Selective workflows, categorized Markdown, issue conventions                  | #100, #106         |
| [Reading continuity](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/2)                 | Document identity, saved positions/bookmarks, recent documents/library search | #13, #14           |
| [EPUB reading](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/3)                       | Reflowable EPUB reading and format-specific persistence                       | #12                |
| [Annotations and reading insights](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/4)   | Highlights, annotations and reading statistics                                | #15                |
| [Reliability and browser acceptance](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/6) | Performance, document safety and supported-browser evidence                   | #16, #28           |
| [Release delivery and closure](https://github.com/HimanshuHD/papertrail-reader/milestone/5)       | Delivery readiness, versioned release/promotion and publisher recovery        | #19, #26, #32, #44 |

Milestone numbers reflect creation order. Complete reliability/browser acceptance before release closure. Each issue retains its own acceptance and dependencies; placing it in a milestone does not mean implementation is complete.

Preparation: #108 is merged for #100; docs-only/manual preview live verification remains. #106 is completed in merged #109; main CI and canonical tracker reconciliation passed. Milestone 1 stays open until #100's controlled docs-only/manual preview/main-merge acceptance passes. Reading continuity #13 is the next product increment after Preparation acceptance.

Multiple-document tabs, session restoration/resource limits, comparison and portable annotation export are assigned to [Roadmap 3](roadmap-3.md), issues #17/#18. Desktop #4/#23/#27 remain deferred outside Roadmap 2 and Roadmap 3. VitePress and a separately hosted docs portal are excluded.
